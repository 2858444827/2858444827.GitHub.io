            Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed 
            through some interesting places on the way:
            <ol>
                <li>Walla Walla, WA, </li>
                <li>Magic City, ID,</li> 
                <li>Bountiful, UT, </li>
                <li>Last Chance, CO,</li> 
                <li>Why, AZ</li> 
                <li>the Truth or Consequences,NM.</li>

            I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the 
            road today:</p>
            <blockquote>
            "Passing cars,<br>
            When you can't see, <br>
            May get you,<br>
            A glimpse, Of etemity."</blockquote>
            <p>
            I definitely won't be passsing any
            cars.

            My first day of trip! I can't believe finally got everything
            packed and ready to go.Because I'am on a Segway.I wasn't able
            to bring a whole lot with me.Just as Lao Tzu would have said,
            <q>A journey of a thousand miles begins with one Segway.</q>
