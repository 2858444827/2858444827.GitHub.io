            This website is build to document Meimei
            and zhuang's life. Record our life, and leave
            affectings. Someday when we are old, we can view 
            this website, and review our past days, that must
            be really interesting. The most thing is, I love 
            you, Meimei.

            This is our first photo shoot. It was the National Day.
            I was embarrassed to get too 
            close to you. I looked goofy then, but Meimei always looked beautiful.
